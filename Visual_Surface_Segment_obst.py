# Name:        Visual_Surface_Segment_obst.py
#
# Purpose:     Processing the flight obstacles within a certain area that penetrate
#              a pregiven surface height and thus can be hazardous to flight operations.
#
#              The data comes in a text file for each area separately and has varying
#              number of flight obstacles. The input text file consists of standard
#              information at the top that does not vary between different text files.
#
#              In order to have a CSV -file with all obstacles and coordinates in
#              decimal degrees - two functions are introduced in this Python script.
#              The first, convert_txt_to_df(), processes the input txt-file and returns
#              a pandas DataFrame that will be further processed with the second
#              function, convert_to_DesDeg(). The second function returns a CSV-file.
